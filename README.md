# To Whom It May Concern
I, Benjamin Fischman know firsthand that the erasure of history is unacceptable. In Hebrew, Benjamin translates to the right hand of G-d. Privacy is a fundamental human right at the intersection of the first and fourth amendment enshrined in the Bill of Rights US Constitution. Land of the free because of the brave, ay bold is my pen. Point of clarification, I am not a lawyer, nor do I wish to claim authority now. Yes, a STEM scholar by education, witty wordsmith of languages, and an aspiring business person of note in truth (i.e.,Satya), said I. For example, if I choose to attend a graduate program in the future, start my own business as a wealth creator, rejoin the rank and file in Big Tech, run for public service opportunity, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. My sincere wish is that this genuine display of personal accountability to duty, honor and achievement will be a blessing rather than a curse on my fate and fortune. Obvious and self-evident are my dreams of leadership, but I digress and prefer to take all worthwhile endeavors one day at a time.

"For the writer intent on truth, life never was, never is (and never will be!) easy: his like have suffered every imaginable harassment — defamation, duels, a shattered family life, financial ruin or lifelong unrelieved poverty, the madhouse, jail", A. Solzhenitsyn... Incredible quote, I can empathize with his survival, a terrible place to be, but a great place to have come from. “United, they became distinguished; distinguished, they became united. And having thus attained self-knowledge, they set out to know everything else”, A. Tertz, The Trial Begins, a serious man, representation of life truthfully as it is — harmonic balance, competition, and etiquette. In my humble opinion, due process is not an exparte affair — veraciously I scribe toward a truth. A truth, like a memory, reconstructed in my mind over and over again ad infinitum.

Hindsight is 2020, and I think, in part, a reason this source code went viral four years ago, to my ignorance at the time, was because it met the requirements of success according to E.F. Schumacher's, Small is Beautiful mantra, for any scientists' or technologists' work to be valuable to winnings it must be:

•	cheap enough so that the methods are virtually accessible to everyone

•	suitable for small scale application; and

•	compatible with the human need for creativity

Tangential backstory for continuity, demonization is not a good idea, but a bit of humor helps the medicine go down. *My mistake*, I deleted this code from GitHub following the guidance of a Principal PM. The Principal shall be referred to here on as Principal Wormer. I listened to the advice of Principal Wormer, and on or around the whereabouts of February 28th, 2018, *my birthday* was so moved to delete this repository for "business" persuaded at the moment via verbal communications with Principal Wormer. Alas, bad choice to allow a superior to impact my firm conviction in the ethics of a thriving open source culture community in the marketplace of ideas. As a witness to the evolution of open data principles, perhaps unimaginable invisible events in relation, I am confident sharing a harmless sample now is doing the right thing at an appropriate time. Think of this as a postmortem, because, checks watch, the code is defunct, which means Facebook innovated to improve their security. In retrospect, the code should probably have remained local and not been put on the internet for a global audience to mangle, but I was a naïve undergraduate student with a desire to impress and an abundance of prideful ignorance. Recall, pride in oneself is a cardinal sin, pride in others, on the other hand, is a virtue. If I could do it over again, with the benefit of wisdom, I would have sent Facebook a professional and polite email notifying the powers that be of a hole in their security architecture free of any expectations with an earnest growth mindset. Thank G-d, the sagacity of time has served to mature my tone. Time heals all wounds and will typically tell weather; what happens next is a victory or defeat, my curiosity is piqued. To quote Mark Twain, history does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme — sublime in literary nature, a Burkean, amirite? I don't pretend to imagine a grudge because perception is reality. To be sure, the remuneration from this stupid idea was a $500 check. I did not receive a single penny, wheat or not, for publishing this software online. Auto course correction, I have made significant donations to 501c3 charities since University well exceeding the $500 mark. Yes, I pay my taxes, continue to volunteer, publish, ask tough questions, and participate in open dialogue to better empower the communities I call home. I work to humble myself and allow the weight of dust to crush me as Ghandi once philosophized in his legendary book, The Story of my Experiments with Truth. And as I write this message to dear readers that will probably rush to judgment, I listen to Chanel Miller's, Know My Name. Today is the 9-year anniversary of a memory Facebook never fails to remember. A photo of myself with a goof ball, perhaps Trumpian, smile, from high school, with a few close personal friends in attendance of an Obama speech at a Honeywell aircraft manufacturing plant in Golden Valley Minnesota, my hometown.

"She sat at the window of the train... The window frame trembled with the speed of motion, the pane hung over empty darkness, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while... She sat listening to the music. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes flowed up... It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean and left nothing but the joy of an unobstructed effort. Only a faint echo within the sounds spoke of that from which the music had escaped but spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain, and there never had to be. It was the song of an immense deliverance. She thought, ‘for just a few moments — while this lasts — it is all right to surrender completely — to forget everything and just permit yourself to feel’. She thought, ‘let go — drop the controls — this is it”, A. Rand, Atlas Shrugged.

Upon further meditation, and inspired by power of recent events, I am choosing to honor righteousness in the consistency of patterns over time to build trust with my dear readers and leave yet another document for posterity. To be clear, this code sample is not intended to help or assist bad actors. And for that matter otherwise be construed as anything but a statement of good faith in service to higher, dare I venture to say noble, ideals. All parties of note have been graciously abstracted within the bounds of common sense to safeguard careers, public shareholders, and personal reputations. Maybe there is a chance we all might prosper as far as our talent performance will allow. The original goal of this project was educational exploration into creation of a system to foster real world communities and build healthy relationships. I think, err hope, we can all agree, it is important to work within the constraints of any system, zero trust is top of mind, to effect change we want to actualize in the world. My dear readers, press pause and reflect to ask oneself, just because I can create something does that mean one should? Grand cliches of the corniest perspectives feel natural, with great power comes great responsibility. Why do we fall? So, we can pick ourselves back up. Comic book nation indeed. Like any well written story, this whole narrative is open to interpretation and human bias — pick your poison or something. As the author I would prefer to frame myself as the leading protagonist. But I am not perfect, and I best acknowledge that, I too don't believe everything I read or hear. Say what you will about tenant, but in my experience a healthy dose of skepticism and diverse love of learning serve to inoculate one's mind to avoid the disaster of gullibility. Feel free to respectfully disagree, but I admit to nothing but a dream and reserve all rights as a private American citizen with respect to the rule of law. In software development, and indeed life, every rule has an exception. For what it's worth, my family’s immigration legacy began in 17th century America with the first ordained Rabbi, Abraham Rice of German origin, in the United States.

I am ecstatic to see what happens next,

-BF

P.S. My middle name is Rice, so to be concise, I suffice a precise optimist.

# Facebook Scraper
### A web scraper for Facebook utilizing Node.js
<br><br>
#### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to collect demographics pertaining to members in a facebook group. The excersize had the intent to empower collegiate educational program recruitment initiatives. The client was on the board of regents at a public University.
As it stands today, **June 3, 2016**,
Facebook_Scraper isn't functional.Adaptation of a previous project
[GSScrapNode](https://github.com/BenjiFischman/GSScrapeNode) literature review aggregation tool for academics 
was accomidated to complete the customer ask.
<br><br>
GSScrapeNode is a version of GSScrape implemented through a Node.js
based webserver and a Google Chrome extension. It is built this way
because extracting titles from a Google Scholar web page is trivial,
but outputting the titles to a file is not. The file output aspect is
what generated a need for a webserver. In a nutshell, GSScrapeNode will
fetch the titles from a Google Scholar results page and post them to
a local webserver. The webserver will then write the titles to a file.
<br><br>
#### Installation
<ol>
	<li>You'll need to be running linux with both npm and nodejs
	installed. Both are available using <code>apt-get</code>.
	You will also need Google Chrome.</li>
	<li>Clone this repo to wherever. That path will be referred to as
	"scraper_path" in the following steps.</li>
	<li>In Chrome load the unpacked extension located in
	scraper_path/extension.</li>
	<li>In the scraper_path directory, run the command
	<code>npm install</code>. This will install the express and
	body-parser node modules</li>
	<li>Next, run <code>nodejs server.js</code><br>You should see a
	message indicating the server is listening on localhost:8080. You
	may change the listening port as needed.</li>
	<li>Navigate to a Google Scholar page with results and click the
	GSScrapeNode extension button. In scraper_path, there will be a new
	file called <code>titles.txt</code> that will hold the titles from
	that page. You may do this on as many pages as needed, and all
	titles will be appended to <code>titles.txt</code>, one title per
	line.</li>
</ol>
